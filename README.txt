For the two charts that are shown on the "Education" page, I used Google's line chart to showcase the annual renewable energy production and the annual total electricity consumption in Florida. I chose a line chart because it shows the datapoints in a way where it's easy for the audience to understand; as time progresses, so does the renewable energy production and total electricity consumption.
