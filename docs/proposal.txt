Objective: The objective of this project is to redesign Florida Energy's website so that it will be easier to use for all types of users. This is necessary because it will improve the user's experience thus keeping them on the page for a longer period of time.
Purpose: The purpose of this project is to improve Florida Energy's website.

State of the current website:
- Accessibility audit: This website is not completely accessible to all users specifically to those who have disabilities. I ran an accessibility audit through Google's Chrome developer tools and found out that the "image elements do not have alt attributes", "links do not have a discernible name", "frame/iframe elements do not have a title", and "form elements do not have associated labels" which are all important for users who uses assistive technology such as a screen readers. In addition, "background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio" which hinders the legibility of the text on the webpage.
- Mobile friendliness: According to Google, the website is not mobile friendly. The "viewport is not set, clickable elements are too close together, the text is too small to read, and the content is wider than the screen". This is problematic because you want the users to be able to see everything on the webpage without them to go out of their way to read your website. By eliminating the horizontal scroll bar, spreading out links, and increasing font size it will increase mobile user's experience.
- Performance: According to Web Page Test, the performance of the website can be improved. The load time of the website is at 4.324s, which isn't too slow but could be improved. The pie graph shows that images take up 55% of requests and 43.4% of bytes. By shrinking the images, we can decrease the time a page will load.
- Functionality: It looks like the website is functioning properly with the links working. Although some site are opening within the page and some are opening in a new tab. I would recommend having external links opened in a new tab so that it keeps the users from leaving the page.
- Ease of Use: Difficult to use due to the amounts of links there are. Two navigation bars can be a little overwhelming. I would recommend condensing the amount of links in the navigation bar. With the site not being mobile friendly, it is difficult to see the whole webpage. Having a horizontal scroll bar, in addition to a vertical scroll bar, makes it troublesome.

User research: The expected user to access this website would be anyone working for the Florida State government, users at its 12 supported universities, the Florida Legislature, Executive Office of the Governor, and the Floridaâ€™s Office of Energy. In addition to those listed, people in public facilities would access this website as well.

Device support necessary: The devices this website should be fluid in laptops, mobile devices, and tablets. Since most of its users are in high level, we expect them to have a fairly stable income meaning they will most likely have high end devices. Also, we would need to support older version of Internet Explorer as well because this website will be mostly used in public education as well as an industry that is not tech savvy. 

Recommendations: I recommend a leaner website with less navigation for ease of use. Probably with 5-7 links per bar max. To do so, we would combine liked links so that there are categories versus one link for every website they have. This will help users find what they need easier without having to read the entire website to see where they should go. Another deliverable is make the website mobile friendly. This will eliminate the horizontal scroll bar so that it will be easier for the user to navigate the website in one direction. Another deliverable is to reduce the image sizes to decrease load time. This will keep users from exiting out of the webpage due to long wait times for content to load. By having a fast load time, users will likely stay on the website and read more about Florida's energy systems consortium.
